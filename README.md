# Electronic-Store-Sales-Data-EDA
### Objectives
* Analysis by Manufacturer: The manufacturing companies can analyse the current market trend along with the price range the consumers are interested in, to fine-tune their product and hence make it available to a larger audience
* Increasing Sales by Retailer: Retailers can increase their sales and profit by analysing when they are getting more customers or when are they getting fewer customers and therefore deciding on how to set their inventory. Therefore, they can avoid filling their inventory with unwanted products.
* Checking Prices by Consumer: The consumers can keep track of when the product they want is at the lowest or most affordable price so they can get the product at the best price.
